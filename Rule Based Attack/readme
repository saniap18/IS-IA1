RULE BASED ATTACK:

Also known as wordlist mutation attack, is a password cracking technique where an attacker uses a set of predefined rules or transformations from a base set of password to generate potential password of guesses. 

From this the passwords that are generated are tested symmetrically against the system for gaining unauthorized access and thereby launching an attack on the system.


Command for rule based attack is:
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 password.txt wordlist.txt -r rule.txt

where -a 0 denotes rule based attack 
      -m 0 denotes MD5 hashed text
      password.txt --> Stores hashed passwords
      wordlist.txt --> Stores potential password guesses
      rule.txt --> A text file containing various rules to be applied after decrypting the password in order to crack it.
