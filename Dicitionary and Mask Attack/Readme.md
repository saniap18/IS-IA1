Dictionary Attack:- 


A dictionary attack is a type of password cracking method where a predefined list of words or phrases, called a dictionary, is systematically checked against hashed passwords to find a match, exploiting common or likely passwords. It's efficient for cracking weak passwords but less effective against complex or randomly generated ones.


Mask Attack:-


A mask attack is a password cracking technique where you specify a pattern or "mask" that represents the possible characters and their positions in the password, allowing for efficient brute-force attempts focused on a specific structure or format, such as a certain length or character set.
